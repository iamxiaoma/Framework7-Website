    h1 Safe Areas
    p With the iPhone X release and further iPhone XS and iPad Pro, Apple introduced so called <b>safe areas</b>, later implemented by Google Chrome with support in Android.
    p On devices with safe areas (like with top screen notch), app UI must include additional top/bottom spacing (to consider top notch and new bottom bar) in portrait orientation and additional left/righ spacing (to consider left/right notch) in landscape orientation.
    p In portrait orientation Framework7 will do required styles modifications automatically, but in landscape orientation some additional classes must be added to elements:
    ul
      li <code>safe-areas</code> - add to element that is stick to both left and right screen edges in landscape orientation
      li <code>safe-area-left</code> - add to element that is stick to the left screen edge in landscape orientation
      li <code>safe-area-right</code> - add to element that is stick to the right screen edge in landscape orientation
      li <code>no-safe-areas</code> - add to element which is is inside of <code>safe-areas</code> to remove additional horizontal spacing
      li <code>no-safe-area-left</code> - add to element which is is inside of <code>safe-areas</code> to remove additional left spacing
      li <code>no-safe-area-right</code> - add to element which is is inside of <code>safe-areas</code> to remove additional right spacing
    p The following elements don't require such classes:
    ul
      li Popup, Sheet - already considered as full screen elements that is required extra spacing on both left and right sides
      li Left Panel - already considered as element that is stick to the left screen edge and requires extra spacing on left side
      li Right Panel - already considered as element that is stick to the right screen edge and requires extra spacing on right side
    p Here is the example app layout with such classes:
    :code(lang="html")
      <body>
        <!-- app root -->
        <div id="app">
          <!-- statusbar -->
          <div class="statusbar"></div>

          <!-- left panel doesn't require any additional classes -->
          <div class="panel panel-left panel-cover">
            ...
          </div>

          <!-- right panel doesn't require any additional classes -->
          <div class="panel panel-right panel-reveal">
            ...
          </div>

          <!-- main view, full-wide element, add "safe-areas" class -->
          <div class="view view-main view-init safe-areas" data-url="/">
            <div class="page">
              <div class="navbar">
                ...
              </div>
              <div class="page-content">
                <!-- full-wide list, will inherit safe-areas from view -->
                <div class="list">
                  ...
                </div>
                <!-- full-wide content block, will inherit safe-areas from view -->
                <div class="block">
                  ...
                </div>
                <!--
                  two-columns blocks: need to
                    - remove extra spacing on right side for left block
                    - remove extra spacing on left side for right block
                -->
                <div class="row">
                  <!-- remove right spacing on left block -->
                  <div class="block col no-safe-area-right">

                  </div>
                  <!-- remove left spacing on right block -->
                  <div class="block col no-safe-area-left">
                    ...
                  </div>
                </div>
                ...
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        ...
